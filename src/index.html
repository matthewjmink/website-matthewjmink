                <h2>My experience</h2>
                <p>Since 2008, I've designed and developed websites and web applications for clients in a variety of industries. I have a passion for
                    creating and coding beautiful user interfaces. My primary concern is that your website's visitors would consider your site a
                    pleasure to use. What does that mean for you? Improved usability means better conversion rates, and my ultimate goal is to
                    increase profit for the companies with whom I work.</p>

            <p>I've been married since 2006 to my beatiful wife, Danielle, with whom I have five kids and an assortment of animals. There's never a
                dull moment around here.</p>
            <p>We're Wisconsinites, through and through &ndash; born and raised here. Given the choice between a tropical beachside resort and a
                secluded Northwoods lake cabin... meet me at the cabin (I'll be the one building the fire).</p>
            <p>I love the outdoors, when I can get into it &ndash; camping, hiking, canoing, etc. &ndash; and the older I get, the more I enjoy
                working with my hands. While web design doesn't usually afford me the opportunity to catch some rays, I do enjoy the aspect of
                creativity that comes with it &ndash; that I can shape and bring life to something previously unknown, something uniquely made with a
                purpose in mind.</p>
